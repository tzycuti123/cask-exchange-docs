### `/api/casks/listing` — Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `page` | number | Default: 1 |
| `size` | number | Default: 10 |
| `status` | `active` \| `inactive` \| `discontinued` | Cask status |
| `isListed` | boolean | Whether listed for sale |
| `search` | string | Search by name, reference, or distillery |
| `minVintageYear` / `maxVintageYear` | number | Vintage year range |
| `minPrice` / `maxPrice` | number | Price range |
| `minAbv` / `maxAbv` | number | ABV range |
| `minRla` / `maxRla` | number | RLA range |

## Cask Metadata (`/api/cask-metadata`)

| Method | Path | Summary | Auth |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| GET | `/api/cask-metadata/ranges` | Get min/max ranges for cask attributes | Public |
| GET | `/api/cask-metadata/sort` | Get available sort options | Public |
| GET | `/api/cask-metadata/classifications` | Get supported cask classifications (enum + label) | 🔒 |

> **Key insight for specs**: `classifications` returns both the enum slug (e.g., `single_malt_scotch`) AND the human-readable label (e.g., `Single Malt Scotch`). This confirms that `classificationLabel` is a derived/computed field from the BE, not a separate DB column.

---

## Distilleries (`/api/distilleries`)

|--------|------|---------|------|
| GET | `/api/distilleries` | Get all distilleries | Public |

| GET | `/api/distilleries/{id}/related` | Get related distilleries (scored) | 🔒 |

> ⚠️ **Important for Top Distilleries specs**: The existing `GET /api/distilleries/top-ranked` sorts by **cask count (DESC)**, NOT by lifetime trading volume. A **new dedicated endpoint** will be needed for the Top Distilleries feature as specified.

## Key Notes for BA Specs Writers

1. **Master Cask vs. Variant Cask:**
   - The `/api/casks` group deals with **variant casks** (children).
   - Master cask data is embedded in the variant response under `master` / `children`.
   - There is **no dedicated `/api/master-casks` endpoint** — master cask interactions happen via variant endpoints.

2. **`classificationLabel` mapping:**
   - Use `GET /api/cask-metadata/classifications` to understand the slug → label mapping.
   - The backend returns both `classification` (slug) and `classificationLabel` (display text).

3. **`region` field:**
   - Region is an **object** (`{ id, name, country, ... }`), not a flat string.
   - When specs reference "region name for display", map it from `region.name` → expose as `regionName` in new endpoints.

4. **Top Distilleries — No existing endpoint:**
   - `GET /api/distilleries/top-ranked` sorts by **cask count**, not volume.
   - A **new endpoint** is required for the Top Distilleries Home feature.

5. **Explore Casks — No existing endpoint:**
   - No current endpoint handles the curated tab structure (Top Traded, Most Watched, etc.).
   - All 4 tabs require new endpoints backed by a **pre-computed stats table**.

6. **`viewCount` tracking:**
   - Tracked at the **variant cask level** via `POST /api/casks/{id}/view`.
   - The `GET /api/casks/listing` supports `sortBy=viewCount` for the Most Watched tab.
